# VRC-Change-Up-Simulator-Mac
### Current Version: Build 0dc 

VRC Change Up Simulator </br> No multiplayer support, unfortunately :(

### Installing on Mac
DISCLAIMER: I have not personally tested this yet as I do not have a Mac. Follow these steps at your own risk.
1. Download and unzip the file
2. Use terminal to navigate to the Contents/MacOS/ directory:<br/>
`cd <PATH TO DIRECTORY CONTAINING THE UNZIPPED FILE>/VRC Change Up (Build 0dc) - Mac OS X.app/Contents/MacOS/`
3. Use chmod to make the file inside executable
`chmod +x <VRC Change Up (Build 0dc)>`
